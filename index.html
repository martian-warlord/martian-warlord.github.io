<h4>Project description: Customize a digital business card using HTML, JS, and CSS.</h4>
<p>For this project I started by looking for a halfway decent picture of myself.  For the past couple of years I've been very focused on being a new parent, so all my pictures are on my son and my wife.  While I was laughing about this problem on the phone with my wife, she suggested a picture where I was bouncing my son up and down.  I had a natural smile, and my son was happy and had a cool blur effect from the exposure.  I thought it was a great suggestion.  Fortunately, this was right before my computer crashed and I had to erase all my data, so I was able to find the pix.  However, the pictures were too personal.  The blur was a blur.  If you didn't know it was my son John, it was a blur. It occured to me that the series would make a good slide show or animated gif.  If all the pictures were shown as a sequence, the viewer would see the blur and see John.  I looked at the example code provided to class and saw two directions that could work.  One example would pull random photos from a repository.  I figured that I could create a timer and loop the request.  The second example used a sprite sheet.  I had always wanted to do a sprite sheet, so I chose that direction.</p>
<p>I was new to the Mac's Photos app, and discovered that they had added an export step to using their photo album directory.  The interface didnt seem to have a step where you chose an end directory for the export, and I didnt want to dig around in the preferences.  So I pulled up the larger view of the photos in the album, and I screen grabbed them.  I then imported the photos into Photoshop.  I created a script to crop and resize one of the photos, and applied it to all of them.  This gave them a uniform dimension.  I then created a canvas for a sprite sheet and dropped them all in.  I saved the sprite sheet for the web and it was only 26k or so.  I wasnt going to be a memory hog.  Yay!</p>
<p>I then thought about attaching the sprite effect to a mouse over event.  My initial problem was that my images didn't work as a still.  If some one looked my card from a mobile device they wouldnt be able to hover.  So, I decided to start the animation on load.  It was less interactive within the context of "mouse interaction" but it's emotional cinematic narrative value was very engaging.  I had initially included a color scrolling effect on the background color but I decided that I already had a strong visual and some times less is more.  </p>

<h4>Project description: Build a digital narrative, using a map/poetry/camera-poem-picker template as a jumping off point.</h4>
<p>I started this project by thinking of two directions.  I love computational poetry.  So I wanted to make poetry machines instead of using static poems.  I also wanted to use word clouds.  Last semester I took a class in data visualization and I was introduced to various text visualization areas.  I love concrete poetry, and Mallarmé's fin de siècle style where poetry is mixed with more spatial arts. </p>
<p>The next part of this project's development worked along two lines.  One line of thought progressed from the word clouds the second progressed from the map api that was provided with the project.</p>
<p>As I thought about word clouds, I started pulling vocabulary words from my standard bag of tricks. I have worked in the area of poetry and automatic writing for a long time, so I have an existing style and body of work that has been my anchor.  It's very easy for me to drop into my comedy/horror/satire work flow. I was thinking about this as I started playing with the map API</p> 
<p>I started customizing the sory-in-pomes template by zooming Googles map API into Fez, Morocco where the streets are so twisted they didnt even publish maps until recently.  It looked great. Map based narrative has recently been more rooted in the video game narrative domain so I started thinking about video game narratives.  One dimesion of game playing a narrative is the use of prescriptive story events rather than descriptive events.</p> 
<p>While I was very happy with the first step of the map based horror/comedy/satire narrative game direction, I reminded myself that some of my better job leads in Madison Wisconsin are doing educational games.  If I wanted to extend the life of this project beyond class goals, I probably wanted to make something fun happy and silly.  I had previous scraped a list of vocabulary words from a wide array of self affirmation posts on the internet.  I decided approach my first word cloud with this list.</p>
<p>To implement the word cloud I started by looking for an example that could generate word clouds dynamically from arrays.  I wanted an approach that could be combined with generative poetry.  I found a nice D3 example, and then found a stripped down version that only used right angles.  I dropped in the list of affirmations and it looked awesome.</p>
<p>Back at the map based approach, I decided that Google Maps wasnt as relevant to this project but that the affirmations worked as an affective map or emotional map.  I thought it would make a good compass pointer for quests.  At this point I was at a cross roads.  The introduction ofthe template as part of the class assignment was suggestive of an assigned approach.  However, a previous conversation I had had with Alec on the subject of class parameters seemed to be open to exploration.  I decided to move forward and double check with Alec.  "Yes" it's a safe assumption that this conceptual jump works with the class's educational goals.  </p>
<p>So the project, at it's core became clicking on word cloud key events and triggering quests from a list that matches the appropriate keyword.  I started thinking about how to export the word array.  It seemed more direct to get this list after it had been propogated to the screen as svg text.  I searched around athe D3 documentation and found the right syntax to add corresponding IDs to each of the text words.  Upon reflection this wasnt necessarily the right approach but I kept it incase I wanted to add animation to a click event.  The next direction was to use D3 click handling syntax to trigger a function that corresponds to each text word. I spent several hours searching for the right documentation to accomplish this direction.  Eventually I asked Alec and he told me about the eval() function to get the string value of an array call. It worked!  I was now triggering corresponding keyword functions based on the keyword click events.  </p>
<p>I then thought about how to display the quest text.  We had just worked on a personal pages with a card flipping effect.  It seemed well suited to a small screen app.  However, I remember the card structure to be a bit convoluted so I searched for a more basic tutorial online.  I looked at five or six examples, asked Shaunalynn for help, and cobbed together a version that worked.</p>


<h2><a href="https://github.com/martian-warlord/DGMDS15">Final Project</a></h2>
<h4>Project description: Creative Exploration in Screen-Based and Physical Computing.</h4>
<h3>SMILE!</h3>
<p>Description: An app that takes a picture, when it detects a smile.</p>
<p>Concept: Police have a PR problem where a lot of messier customer contacts have been publicized.  One of the critiques of police is that they are not emotionally sensitive in their work.  This app aims to gamify police work and reinforce positive police contacts.  It uses a body cam to take a picture whenever anyone smiles.  Smile pictures can reinforce positive police self image.  Counts of smile pictures can be used in competition in order to encourage positive emotional interaction between police and customers.</p>
<p>Prototype details: This project will use JS Node and a go pro camera to connect to a face/smile recognition API.  When a smile is detected it will save a picture to a smart phone.
<ul>
<li>Target User: Police with body cams</li>
<li>Problem it solves: Emotional Awareness and PR</li>
<li>Hardware list: Body cam and Harness, smart phone </li></ul>
